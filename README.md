# Image-classifier-using-scikit-learn
# Description:
In this project, we build a basic image classifier using scikit-learn. We'll use the Digits dataset, which contains 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits (0â€“9). We extract pixel features and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to recognize the digits.


# ðŸ§  What This Project Demonstrates:
* Converts image data into features (pixel values)

* Trains an SVM classifier for multi-class classification

* Evaluates results with classification report and confusion matrix

* Visualizes both input data and performance metrics
